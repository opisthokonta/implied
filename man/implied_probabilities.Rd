\title{Implied probabilities from bookmaker odds.}
\usage{
implied_probabilities(odds, method = "basic", normalize = TRUE,
  grossmargin = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{odds}{A matrix or numeric of bookmaker odds. The odds must be in the decimal format.}

\item{method}{A string giving the method to use. Valid methods are 'basic', 'shin', 'bb',
'wpo', 'or', 'power' or 'additive'.}

\item{normalize}{Logical. Some of the methods will give small rounding errors. If TRUE (default)
a final normalization is applied to make absoultely sure the
probabilities sum to 1.}

\item{grossmargin}{Numeric. Must be 0 or greater. See the details.}
}
\value{
A named list. The first component is named 'probabilities' and contain a matrix of
implied probabilities. The second in the bookmaker margins (aka the overround). The third
depends on the method used to compute the probabilities:
\itemize{
 \item{ zvalues (method = 'shin' and method='bb'): The estimated amount of insider trade.}
 \item{ specific_margins (method = 'wpo'): Matrix of the margins applied to each outcome.}
 \item{ odds_ratios (method = 'or'): Numeric with the odds ratio that is used to convert true
 probabilities to bookamker probabilties.}
 \item{ exponents (method = 'power'): The (inverse) exponents that is used to convert true
 probabilities to bookamker probabilties.}
}

The fourth compnent 'problematic' is a logical vector called indicating if any probabilites has fallen
outside the 0-1 range, or if there were some other problem computing the probabilities.

\description{
This function calculate the implied probabilties from bookmaker odds in decimal format, while
accounting for overround in the odds.
}
\details{
The method 'basic' is the simplest method, and computes the implied probabilities by
dividing the inverted odds by the sum of the inverted odds.

The method 'shin' uses the method by Shin (1992, 1993). This model assumes that there is a fraction of
insider trading, and that the bookmakers tries to maximize their profits. In addition to providing
implied probabilties, the method also gives an estimate of the proportion if inside trade. The method
implemented here is based on the algorithm in Jullien & Salanié (1994).

The 'bb' (short for "balanced books") method is from Fingleton & Waldron (1999), and is a variant of Shin's method. It too assume
a fraction of insiders, but instead of assuming that the bookmakers maximize their profits, they
minimize their risk.

Both the 'shin' and 'bb' methods can be used together with the 'grossmargin' argument. This is also
from the Fingleton & Waldron (1999) paper, and adds some further assumption to the calculations,
related to opperating costs. grossmargin should be 0 (default) or greater, typical range is 0 to 0.05.
For values other than 0, this might sometimes cause some probabilities to not be identifiable. A warning
will be given if this happens.

The methods 'wpo' (Weights Proportional to the Odds), 'or' (Odds Ratio) and 'power' are form the Wisdom of the Crowds document (the updated version) by
Joseph Buchdahl. The method 'or' is origianlly by Cheung (2015), and the method 'power' is there referred
to as the logarithmic method.
