# implied Version 0.3.2
* Fixed wrong formula for the WPO method in the introduction vignette.

# implied Version 0.3.1
* Raises error if the inverse odds sum to less than 1.
* NA's will be returned if there are NA's in the input odds.

# implied Version 0.3.0
* A new algorithm for Shin's method is included.
* Small bugfix for when Shin's method fails and produces NA's. Instead of crashing, it now raises a warning and flags the result as problematic.
